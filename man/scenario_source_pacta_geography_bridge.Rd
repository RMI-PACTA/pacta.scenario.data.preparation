\title{A dataset that maps scenario regions as defined by their source, to a list of
PACTA compatible scenario regions.}
\format{
An object of class \code{spec_tbl_df} (inherits from \code{tbl_df}, \code{tbl}, \code{data.frame}) with 15 rows and 3 columns.

\description{
Scenario providers often define their own, tailor-made lists of what
countries form a region. The entire concept of a region is not standardized
and can even change year on year. However, for the purpose of the PACTA
transition monitor website, it is useful to have a minimal set of comparable
regions, to cycle through different scenarios for. Right now, these regions
are the "Global" region, which contains all countries, and the "OECD" and
"NonOECD" regions.

This dataset provides a bridge between whatever the scenario has labelled
these regions as (e.g. "WORLD"), and the terminology that PACTA uses
(e.g. "Global").
